Audio drone project

An audio installation that creates a background / mediattive 'drone' sound which will be interrupted when an actual drone strike has been reported to have taken place somewhere on the planet.

== About ==

This audio installation was developed by Mark Simpkins and Cathal Coughlan during the time of Mark's residency at the Lighthouse Studio programme November 2013 - February 2014, Brighton, UK.

== First Sketch ==

Using dronestre.am as a data source. 

== Installation History ==

The work has been installed at:

* Friday 13th December 2013 - Show & Tell at Lighthouse. An afternoon lecture/presentation on the work I was doing at the residency. The drone was played as a continual background sound during the presentation, with half the presentation discussing the reasoning and working of the piece.

* Thursday 30th January 2014 - SLR Event at Lighthouse, Brighton. I curated a set of interactive pieces installed around the gallery for the evening of the premiere of the short film SLR. Palindrone was installed in one of the gallery spaces.
